# Connecting Telearr to Sonarr, Radarr & Prowlarr

Telearr can act as **both** a Newznab indexer and a SABnzbd-compatible download
client, so your existing \*arr stack can treat Telegram channels as a usenet-like
source: search → grab → download → import, using the workflow you already run.

This guide walks through the setup. It assumes Telearr is running and reachable at
`http://<host>:8790` and that you've already added and mapped a channel or two in
the Telearr UI.

> **Heads up.** This integration is young. It works, but it is intentionally
> conservative and has [known limitations](#known-limitations). Read those before
> filing an issue.

## Overview

```
Prowlarr / Sonarr / Radarr
        │  (1) search            (2) grab
        ▼                            ▼
  Newznab indexer  ───────►  SABnzbd download client
  GET /api/newznab           (same host:8790, api key)
        │                            │
        └──────────► Telearr ◄────────┘
                        │
             existing scanner + fast downloader
                        │
                Plex-ready library  →  Sonarr/Radarr import
```

## Step 1 — Get your API key

1. Open the Telearr web UI at `http://<host>:8790` and log in.
2. Go to **Settings**.
3. Copy the **API key** shown there. This single key authenticates both the
   Newznab indexer and the SABnzbd client. Treat it like a password — anyone with
   it can enqueue downloads.

If you rotate the key later, update it in every \*arr app that uses it.

---

## Step 2 — Add Telearr as a Newznab indexer

You can add it in **Prowlarr** (recommended — it then syncs to Sonarr/Radarr) or
directly in Sonarr/Radarr. The fields are the same.

**In Prowlarr:** *Settings → Indexers → Add Indexer → Generic Newznab.*
**In Sonarr/Radarr:** *Settings → Indexers → Add → Newznab.*

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `Telearr` |
| URL | `http://<host>:8790/api/newznab` |
| API Path | `/api/newznab` |
| API Key | the key from Step 1 |
| Categories | `5000` (TV) for Sonarr, `2000` (Movies) for Radarr |

Notes:

- Use the host/IP where Telearr runs, reachable from the \*arr container/host. If
  everything is on one Docker network, use the service name (e.g.
  `http://telearr:8790/api/newznab`).
- **Categories** follow the Newznab standard: `5000` = TV, `2000` = Movies. Map
  Sonarr to TV and Radarr to Movies.
- Click **Test**. Telearr answers the Newznab `caps` request; a green test means
  the indexer is reachable and the API key is valid.

---

## Step 3 — Add Telearr as a SABnzbd download client

**In Sonarr/Radarr:** *Settings → Download Clients → Add → SABnzbd.*

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `Telearr` |
| Host | `<host>` (or the Docker service name) |
| Port | `8790` |
| API Key | the same key from Step 1 |
| Use SSL | Off (unless you front Telearr with TLS) |
| Category | e.g. `tv` for Sonarr, `movies` for Radarr |

Click **Test**. Sonarr/Radarr will query the SABnzbd-compatible endpoints; a green
test means Telearr responded as a SABnzbd client.

> Set a **Category** so grabs are tagged and the \*arr app can find the finished
> files for import. Keep the category consistent with how your library paths are
> laid out.

---

## Step 4 — How grabs flow

1. **Search.** Sonarr/Radarr (directly or via Prowlarr) sends a Newznab
   `tvsearch`/`movie` query to `/api/newznab`. Telearr returns matching releases
   drawn from your watched Telegram channels, each with a GUID.
2. **Grab.** When the \*arr app decides to grab a release, it hands the download to
   its SABnzbd client — Telearr. Telearr resolves the release GUID back to the
   specific Telegram message.
3. **Download.** The grab is enqueued into Telearr's normal pipeline and pulled via
   the fast multi-connection downloader, subject to the same concurrency limit,
   dedup, and naming as an organic scan.
4. **Report & import.** Telearr reports queue/history status back through the
   SABnzbd endpoints. When the file completes, it lands in the library where the
   \*arr app expects it, and Sonarr/Radarr imports it as usual.

## Known limitations

This integration is new — please keep expectations calibrated:

- **Search quality depends on channel metadata.** Telearr matches on what channels
  actually post (filenames/captions). Poorly labeled channels yield poor Newznab
  results. Mapping a channel to an IMDb title in the UI improves naming and
  matching.
- **No true "grab anything" search.** Telearr can only offer what its channels have
  posted (and, depending on configuration, what it can backfill) — it is not a
  general usenet indexer.
- **Sizes/quality flags are best-effort.** Quality is inferred from filename tokens
  (`1080p`, `2160p`, etc.); releases without clear tokens may be categorized
  imperfectly.
- **One download at a time by default.** `HERMES_MAX_CONCURRENT` defaults to `1`;
  \*arr grabs queue behind organic scans and each other.
- **Categories are limited** to TV (`5000`) and Movies (`2000`). Anime, and finer
  sub-categories, are not specifically modeled yet.
- **Single-instance / single-worker.** Telearr runs one scanner in one process; the
  indexer/client APIs share that process.
- **Protocol coverage is partial.** Telearr implements the SABnzbd/Newznab
  functions the \*arr apps actually call, not the entire specifications. If your \*arr
  version calls something unimplemented, please open an issue with the request
  details.

Found a gap or a bug? Please file an issue with your Sonarr/Radarr/Prowlarr
versions and the exact request/response — that's the fastest way to get it fixed.
